## The essence of local privacy

 At the heart of these protocols, each user is asked a simple question
 about their data by a data analyst. The user then determines randomly
 whether to answer the question truthfully, or to pick some false
 response, according to a specified probability distribution. This
 randomization gives each user “plausible deniability”, and protects
 their privacy.


To fully specify a protocol: 

(1) we need to determine what questions
are asked, 
(2) and what probability distribution is used over the set of
possible answers. 

We also need to show how the data analyst can combine the answers to
build a picture of the overall frequency distribution, and understand
the accuracy of the results.

## Background Material 

### Local privacy 

Already defined 

### Hadamard Transformation

A special case of the discrete fourier transform.

### Pure Protocols

Wang et al. Needs a little bit of thinking as to what they really are.
