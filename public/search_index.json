Theorem 3.1 (Smooth Distributions guarantee DP) Suppose \\(q: \\mathcal{X}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^M\\) is \\(k\\)-incremental i.e. for all neighbouring datasets \\(X \\sim X^{\\prime}\\) we have \\(||q(X) - q(X^{\\prime}) ||_{\\infty} = k\\) and \\(\\Delta(q) = || q(X) - q(X^{\\prime}) ||_1 = \\Delta\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) be a \\((\\varepsilon, \\delta, k)\\)-smooth distribution. Then the mechanism \\(M\\) \\[\\begin{equation*} M_{(Y_1, \\dots, Y_M)}(X, q) = q(X) + (Y_1, \\dots, Y_M) \\end{equation*}\\] is \\((\\epsilon\\Delta, \\delta\\Delta)\\) differentially private, where \\((Y_1, \\dots, Y_M) \\overset{\\text{i.i.d}}{\\sim} D.\\) Proof. Let \\(X = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\) where \\(x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(X^\\prime = (x_1, \\dots, x_n^\\prime)\\). Let \\(\\vec{y} = (y_1, \\dots, y_M)\\) and \\(\\vec{Y} = (Y_1, \\dots, Y_M)\\) be i.i.d draws from \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). Assume that Equation (3.1) holds \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[g(\\vec{y}) \\geq e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}]} \\leq \\delta^\\prime \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(g(\\vec{y}) = \\frac{\\Pr_{(\\vec{Y} \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[M_{\\vec{Y}}(X, q) = q(X) + \\vec{y} ]}}{\\Pr_{(\\vec{Y} \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[M_{\\vec{Y}}(X^\\prime, q) = q(X^\\prime) + \\vec{y} ]}}\\). Let \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}^M\\) be an arbitrary subset in the range of \\(M\\). Let \\(T = \\{M_{\\vec{y}(X, q)} | g(\\vec{y}) &lt; e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\}\\) represent a set of outputs of \\(M\\) over draws of \\(\\vec{y}\\) such that \\(g(\\vec{y}) &lt; e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\). Then from equation (3.1) we can show that \\(M\\) is \\((\\varepsilon^\\prime, \\delta^\\prime)\\) differentially private \\[\\begin{align} \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[M_{\\vec{y}}(X, q) \\in S]} &amp;\\leq \\delta^\\prime + \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[M_{\\vec{y}}(X, q) \\in S \\cap T]} \\tag{3.2}\\\\ &amp;= \\delta^\\prime + \\sum_{w \\in S \\cap T }\\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[M_{\\vec{y}}(X, q) = w]} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\delta^\\prime + \\sum_{w \\in S \\cap T }e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[M_{\\vec{y}}(X^\\prime, q) = w]} \\tag{3.3}\\\\ &amp;\\leq \\delta^\\prime + \\sum_{w \\in S}e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[M_{\\vec{y}}(X^\\prime, q) = w]} \\tag{3.4}\\\\ &amp;= \\delta^\\prime + e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{[M_{\\vec{y}}(X^\\prime, q) \\in S]} \\end{align}\\] Equation (3.2) is from the law of total probability, equation (3.2) comes from equation (3.1) assumption and equation (3.4) is true as \\(T \\cap S \\subseteq S\\). Therefore all there is to do is to show that equation (3.1) is true if \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is as defined and \\(\\varepsilon^\\prime = \\varepsilon\\Delta, \\delta^\\prime= \\delta\\Delta\\) to complete the proof. Define \\(k_j = q(X)_j - q(X^\\prime)_j\\). As each coordinate of \\(q(X)\\) is independently perturbed and \\(q\\) is a deterministic function, equation @ref(eq: smooth-dp) is equivalent to equation (3.5). \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.5} \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{\\Bigg[ \\prod_{j=1}^M \\frac{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j ]}}{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j + k_j ]}} \\geq e^{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\Bigg]} \\leq \\delta^\\prime \\end{equation}\\] Thus, in order to prove equation (3.1) is true, it suffices to show that equation (3.5) holds. We know that \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a smooth distribution i.e for each \\(j \\in [M]\\) \\[\\begin{align} \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{\\Bigg[ \\frac{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j ]}}{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j + k_j ]}} \\geq e^{|k_j|\\varepsilon}\\Bigg]} \\leq \\delta \\end{align}\\] We can apply the union bound to get the probability that the joint distribution over all indices to get \\[\\begin{align} \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{\\Bigg[ \\prod_{j=1}^M \\frac{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j ]}}{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j + k_j ]}} \\geq e^{\\sum_{j=1}^m|k_j|\\varepsilon}\\Bigg]} \\leq \\delta \\sum_{j=1}^M \\mathbb{I}(k_j \\neq 0) \\end{align}\\] Given the sensitivity of \\(q\\) is \\(\\Delta\\), at most \\(\\Delta\\) indices for \\(k_j\\) can be non zero and \\((\\sum_{j=1}^M |k_j|) = \\Delta\\). Finally we get the result we want \\[\\begin{align} \\Pr_{\\vec{y} \\sim \\mathcal{D}}{\\Bigg[ \\frac{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{\\prod_{j=1}^M [Y_j = y_j ]}}{\\Pr_{(Y_j \\sim \\mathcal{D})}{[Y_j = y_j + k_j ]}} \\geq e^{\\Delta\\varepsilon}\\Bigg]} \\leq \\delta \\Delta \\label{eq: non_zero} \\end{align}\\] Ahoy 3.1 Lemma 3.1 Let \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(p \\in [0, 1/2]\\), \\(\\alpha \\in [0,1)\\) and \\(k \\leq \\frac{n\\alpha p}{2}\\). Then the binomial distribution \\(Bin(n, p)\\) is a \\((\\varepsilon, \\delta, k)\\)-smooth distribution. Proof. Let \\(Y \\sim Bin(np)\\), then \\(\\Pr{[Y = y]} = {n \\choose y}p^{y}(1-p)^{n-y}\\). For any \\(-k \\leq k^\\prime \\leq k\\), define an interval \\(\\mathcal{\\varepsilon} := [(1 - \\alpha)np + k^\\prime, (1 + \\alpha)np - k^\\prime]\\). This an interval of size \\(k\\) around the mean of the distribution. Note that as long as \\(k \\leq \\frac{np}{2}\\alpha\\), then the interval \\(\\mathcal{\\varepsilon^\\prime} := [(1 - \\alpha/2)np, (1 + \\alpha/2)np]\\) is contained inside of \\(\\mathcal{\\varepsilon}\\). Thus if \\(y \\sim Bin(np)\\) is not in \\(\\mathcal{\\varepsilon}\\), it is also not inside \\(\\mathcal{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\). We know how to bound the probability that \\(y \\notin \\mathcal{\\varepsilon^\\prime}\\) by using the multiplicative chernoff bound. Invoking it, we get \\[\\begin{align} \\Pr_{y \\sim Bin(n,p)}{[y \\notin \\epsilon]} &amp;\\leq \\Pr_{y \\sim Bin(n,p)}{[y \\notin \\epsilon^\\prime]} \\\\ &amp;\\leq e^{-\\frac{-\\alpha^2np}{8}} + e^{-\\frac{-\\alpha^2np}{8+2\\alpha}} \\\\ &amp;= \\delta \\\\ \\end{align}\\] Now for all \\(y \\in \\mathcal{\\varepsilon}\\), we have for \\(0 \\leq k^\\prime \\leq k\\) \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\Pr{[Y = y]}}{\\Pr{[Y = y + k^\\prime]}} &amp;= \\Big(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\Big)^{k^\\prime} \\prod_{i=1}^{k^\\prime} \\frac{y + i}{n-y -i+1} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\Big(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\Big)^{k^\\prime} \\Big(\\frac{y + k^\\prime}{n-y -k^\\prime}\\Big)^{k^\\prime} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\Big(\\frac{1-p}{p}\\Big)^{k^\\prime} \\Big(\\frac{(1 + \\alpha)np}{n- (1 + \\alpha)np}\\Big)^{k^\\prime} \\tag{3.6}\\\\ &amp;= (1 + \\alpha)^{k^\\prime} \\Big(\\frac{1-p}{1- p - p\\alpha}\\Big)^{k^\\prime} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] TODO Ari/Graham fix the the last inequality (3.6) comes from our assumption \\(y \\in \\mathcal{\\varepsilon}\\) and so when \\(y=(1 + \\alpha)np - k^\\prime\\) the ratio above is the largest. Similarly for \\(-k \\leq k^\\prime \\leq 0\\) we have \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{\\Pr{[Y = y]}}{\\Pr{[Y = y + |k^\\prime |]}} &amp;= \\Big(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\Big)^{|k^\\prime|} \\prod_{i=1}^{|k^\\prime|} \\frac{n-y +i}{y - i + 1} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\Big(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\Big)^{|k^\\prime|} \\Big( \\frac{n-y +|k^\\prime|}{y - |k^\\prime|}\\Big)^{|k^\\prime|} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\Big( \\frac{1 + p\\alpha - p}{(1-\\alpha)(1 - p)}\\Big)^{|k^\\prime|} \\label{eq: plug_in} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\Big(\\frac{1 + \\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}\\Big)^{|k^\\prime|}\\tag{3.7} \\\\ &amp;= e^{|k|\\varepsilon} \\end{align}\\] (3.6) comes from plugging in the smallest value for \\(y\\) and (3.7) comes from the fact that \\(p \\leq 1/2\\) Finally we can prove smoothness using bayes rule. Let \\(g(y) = \\frac{Pr_{Y \\sim Bin(n,p)}[Y = y]}{Pr_{Y \\sim Bin(n, p)}[Y = y+k^{\\prime}]}\\) \\[\\begin{align} Pr_{y \\sim Bin(n, p)} \\Big[ g(y) \\geq e^{|k^{\\prime}|\\epsilon}\\Big] &amp;\\leq Pr_{y \\sim Bin(n, p)} \\Big[ g(y) \\geq e^{|k^{\\prime}|\\epsilon} \\Big| y \\notin \\mathcal{\\varepsilon} \\Big] + \\delta \\\\ &amp;\\leq e^{-\\frac{-\\alpha^2np}{8}} + e^{-\\frac{-\\alpha^2np}{8+2\\alpha}} \\tag{3.8} \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\delta \\end{align}\\] (3.8) comes from the fact that when \\(y \\in \\mathcal{\\varepsilon}\\) we have \\(\\frac{\\Pr{[Y = y]}}{\\Pr{[Y = y + k^\\prime]}} \\leq e^{\\varepsilon}|k^\\prime|\\) and by how we defined \\(\\varepsilon\\) in equation (3.7). So we have \\(Pr_{y \\sim Bin(n, p)} \\Bigg[ \\frac{Pr_{Y \\sim Bin(n,p)}[Y = y]}{Pr_{Y \\sim Bin(n, p)}[Y = y+k^{\\prime}]} \\geq e^{|k^{\\prime}|\\epsilon} \\Big| y \\notin \\mathcal{\\varepsilon} \\Bigg] = 0\\) References "],["beavers-triples.html", " 4 Beavers Triples", " 4 Beavers Triples #cryptography #mpc Todo SNIPS notes "],["simulation-for-mpc.html", " 5 Simulation for MPC 5.1 Bit oblivious transfer 5.2 Static Semi Honest PPT Adversaries 5.3 Malicious OT 5.4 Covert OT", " 5 Simulation for MPC #cryptography #mpc Let’s say we have \\(n\\) parties indexed by \\(\\{1, \\dots, n \\}\\). Each party possesses private information \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) that they do not want anyone else to know. However, each person also wishes to compute some function over everyone’s private values. For example, they might want to compute \\(f\\) where \\(f\\) is the sum of their values \\(f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\). One way to compute such an \\(f\\) is for everyone to send their private inputs to a trusted third party, which then outputs only the sum of the inputs to each party and nothing else. Caption In reality, finding a third party we can trust with our data is difficult (how on earth can we manifest Mufasa ?). So instead, we must design a protocol \\(\\pi_f\\) which specifies messages each party must send each other to compute their desired function \\(f\\). For this protocol \\(\\pi_f\\) to be helpful, it must satisfy some properties. Firstly, we must ensure that if every party followed the instructions by \\(\\pi_f\\), we would compute \\(f\\) correctly. If \\(f\\) is deterministic, then the output of \\(\\pi_f(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\) must equal \\(f(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\). If \\(f\\) is random, the two protocols should be similar in distribution. Depending on the setting used, the definition of ‘similar’ changes, but let’s not bother with it now. Secondly, it must be secure. Intuitively we want the protocol to reflect our desire that no one else learns anything about our private values. However, learning anything is hard to define mathematically. We can try to exhaustively list everything we do not want an adversary \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) to learn, but this is not very practical. We do not know what information \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) will have when using the protocol. For example, the excerpt from (Lindell 2017) describes why the exhaustive listing is not a great idea. If we say that an adversary receiving a ciphertext cannot output any information about the plaintext, what happens if the adversary already has information about the plaintext? For example, the adversary may know that it is an English text. Of course, this has nothing to do with the security of the scheme since the adversary knew this beforehand and independently of the ciphertext So instead, we need a different approach to declare that \\(\\pi_f\\) is secure. We first define some limits on the adversarial behaviour we hope to secure against. Note that this definition differs from trying to list everything an adversary can do. It is more of a general description of restrictions we place on adversaries or the class of adversaries we want to defend against. For example, an adversary may be computationally unbounded or restricted to polynomial-time probabilistic computations. An adversary could be passive, i.e. they are forced to follow the instructions of a protocol and can only hope to learn side information by looking at the transcript of the protocol. The adversary could be active or malicious in that they arbitrarily deviate from the \\(\\pi_f\\)’s specification. An adversary could be static, i.e. their plan of attack is fixed before executing \\(\\pi_f\\) or dynamic in which they adapt their strategy based on previous messages. Once we define the class of adversaries we want to defend against; we return to our perfect world with Mufasa. Then we construct an algorithm (referred to as the simulator) that interacts with the ideal functionality and interacts with the adversary \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and outputs some information. Informally a protocol \\(\\pi_f\\) is secure if \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) can do as much harm in the real world as they are in this perfect world with Mufasa. Put another way; we would like to show that there is a simulator that can output any information that \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) can learn in the real world. If this is the case, then \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) did not do any real harm as whatever they were able to learn could be learned in our perfect protected world. This discussion is quite abstract, and it might be hard to understand how to construct a secure protocol in practice. To better understand the security of MPC protocols, we look at three protocols that help us compute the oblivious transfer function with the most common classes of adversaries. We choose oblivious transfer, as it is a fundamental MPC primitive that enables us to compute general arithmetic and boolean circuits securely. 5.1 Bit oblivious transfer We consider the bit oblivious transfer functionality, defined by \\(f_{OT}\\Big((b0,b1),\\sigma \\Big) = (\\lambda,b_\\sigma)\\), where \\(b_0,b_1 ,\\sigma ∈ \\{0,1\\}\\). In words, \\(P_1\\) has a pair of input bits \\((b_0,b_1)\\) and P2 has a choice bit \\(\\sigma\\). The function is such that P1 receives no output (denoted by the empty string \\(\\lambda\\)), and in particular learns nothing about \\(\\sigma\\). In contrast, P2 receives the bit of its choice \\(b_\\sigma\\) and learns nothing about the other bit \\(b_{1−\\sigma}\\). SEE PICTURE In this writeup, we only consider static adversaries that are computationally bounded, i.e., PPT. Additionally, as OT is a two-party protocol, we assume that the adversary \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) controls one party and is responsible for sending messages. 5.2 Static Semi Honest PPT Adversaries These are the weakest class of adversaries we work with. Such adversaries cannot force a party to deviate from \\(\\pi_f\\). They can only do bad things with what they see while executing \\(\\pi_f\\). To define security we first have to describe some general notation. We write down the definition in terms of a 2 party protocol but it can be extended for \\(n\\) party protocol.s Let \\(f = (f1,f2)\\) be a probabilistic polynomial-time functionality and let \\(\\pi\\) be a two-party protocol for computing \\(f\\). The view of the \\(i\\)’th party \\(i \\in \\{1, 2\\}\\) during the execution of \\(\\pi\\) on inputs \\((x,y)\\) and security parameter \\(n\\) is denoted by \\(view_i^\\pi(x,y,n)=(w; r^i, m_1^i, \\dots, m_t^i)\\) where \\(w \\in \\{ x, y\\}\\) depending on the input value of the \\(i\\)’th party, \\(r^i\\) is the contents of the internal random tape of the \\(i\\)’th party and \\(m_j^i\\) represents the \\(j\\)’th message it received from the other party. The output of the \\(i\\)’th party denoted by \\(output_i^\\pi(x,y,n)\\) is a PPT function of the view of the \\(i\\)’th party. The final output of the protcol is given by \\(output^\\pi\\big(1^n, x, y, n \\big) = \\Big(output_1^\\pi\\big(1^n, x, y, n \\big), output_2^\\pi\\big(1^n, x, y, n \\big)\\Big)\\) In the real world, the two parties execute the protocol by exchanging messages with each \\(\\alpha\\) other. Caption Definition 5.1 (Security against static semi-honest adversaries) We say that \\(\\pi\\) securely computes \\(f\\) in presence of static semi-honest adversaries if there exists PPT algorithms \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) such that the joint distribution of the following probability ensembles are computationally indistinguishable \\[\\begin{align} \\{ \\Big(S_1 \\big(1^n, x, f_1(x,y) \\big), f(x,y)\\Big) \\}_{x, y, n} \\overset{\\mathsf{comp}}\\equiv \\{ \\Big(view_1^\\pi\\Big(1^n, x, y, n \\Big), output^\\pi\\big(1^n, x, y, n \\big)\\Big)\\}_{x, y, n} \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align} \\{ \\Big(S_2 \\big(1^n, x, f_1(x,y) \\big), f(x,y)\\Big) \\}_{x, y, n} \\overset{\\mathsf{comp}}\\equiv \\{ \\Big(view_2^\\pi\\Big(1^n, x, y, n \\Big), output^\\pi\\big(1^n, x, y, n \\big)\\Big)\\}_{x, y, n} \\end{align}\\] where \\(x,y \\in \\{ 0, 1\\}^*\\) such that \\(|x| = |y|\\) and \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) 5.2.1 Background Summary about one way permutations 5.2.2 Protocol Next, we describe \\(\\pi_{OT}\\) for computing \\(f_{OT}\\) and show that it is secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries.

Namely, show that \\(L \\in \\mathcal{BPP}\\) if there exists a polynomial \\(p(·)\\) and a probabilistic polynomial-time machine \\(M\\) such that for every \\(x \\in L\\) it holds that \\(P[M(x)=1] \\geq \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{p(|x|)}\\) Non false positiveness: for every \\(x \\notin L\\) it holds that \\(P[M(x)=0] \\geq \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{p(|x|)}\\) Same idea as above but using Chebychev’s instead of Chernoff. Did not want to write latex so uploading picture of solution. 8.6 Problem 6 Now do the same again: but replace \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) by \\(1 + \\frac{1}{2^{p(|x|)}}\\) Used as aid Assume \\(L \\in \\mathcal{BPP}\\), this implies that there exists some probabilistic polynomial time turing macine \\(M\\) such that \\(P\\Big[ M(x) = 1 | x \\in L \\Big] \\geq 2/3\\). Define \\(r_1, \\dots, r_{t(n)}\\) as randomv variables sampled uniformly at random from \\(U^n\\). For the sake convenience we will write \\(t(n) = t\\). Define \\(X_i = 1\\) if \\(M_{r_i}(x) = I[x \\in L]\\). Simply put if \\(X_i=1\\), then \\(M_{r}\\) predicted correctly. Let \\(S_t = X_1 + \\dots + X_{r_t}\\). Define a turing machine \\(\\hat{M}\\) such that \\(\\hat{M}(x) = 1\\) if \\(S_t \\geq \\frac{t}{2}\\). In other words, \\(\\hat{M}\\) selects the majority from the predictions of the random machines. Note each \\(X_i\\) is a bernoulli random variable with \\(P\\Big[X_i = 1 | x\\in L\\Big] = p \\geq \\frac{2}{3}\\) Reminder, the chernoff bound, for a sum of \\(t\\) bernoulli variables with mean \\(q\\) is \\[\\begin{align*} P[S_t \\leq (1 - \\delta)qt] \\leq \\text{exp}\\{- \\frac{\\delta^2p}{2}\\} \\end{align*}\\] Now \\(\\hat{M}\\) makes a mistake if \\(x \\in L\\) but \\(S_t \\leq t/2\\) \\[\\begin{align*} P[\\hat{M} \\text{ makes a mistake}] &amp;= P\\Big[ S_t \\leq \\frac{t}{2} \\text{ | } x \\in L \\Big] \\\\ &amp;= P\\Big[ S_t \\leq (1 - (1 - \\frac{1}{2p}))pt \\text{ | } x \\in L \\Big] \\\\ &amp;\\leq \\exp\\{- t\\frac{(p - 1/2)^2}{2p}\\} \\\\ &amp;= \\exp\\{- f(p)\\frac{t}{2}\\} \\tag{8.2} \\end{align*}\\] (8.2) \\(f(p) = \\frac{(p - 1/2)^2}{p}\\) is an increasing function in \\((1/2, \\infty)\\), therefore \\(e^{-f(p)}\\) is decreasing. We have \\(p \\geq 2/3\\), therefore \\(e^{-f(p)} \\leq e^{-f(2/3)} = e^{-\\frac{1}{24}}\\). Using this, \\[\\begin{align*} P[\\hat{M} \\text{ makes a mistake}] &amp;= P\\Big[ S_t \\leq \\frac{t}{2} \\text{ | } x \\in L \\Big] \\\\ &amp;= \\exp\\{- f(p)\\frac{t}{2}\\} \\\\ &amp;= \\exp\\{- \\frac{1}{24}\\frac{t}{2}\\} \\\\ &amp;\\leq 2^{-p(n)} \\end{align*}\\] If \\(t(n) \\geq (48 \\ln(2))p(n) \\approx O(n)\\), then \\(\\hat{M}\\) is poly turing machine that does the job The other side is trivial, in that, pick \\(p(n) \\geq -\\ln(1/3)\\) and assume \\(P\\Big[ M(x) = 1 | x \\in L \\Big] \\geq 1 - 2^{-p(n)}\\). Then \\(P\\Big[ M(x) = 1 | x \\in L \\Big] \\geq \\frac{2}{3}\\).
