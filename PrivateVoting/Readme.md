# Private Voting

## Setup

Define an election system like in [[1][1]]. This is just different voting systems -- has nothing to do with privacy. Plurality, Condorcet methods etc. 

## Privacy models 

* Passive Security
* Malicious -- zero knowledge proofs etc.

## Plurality methods

Plurality voting is a system in which the candidate(s) with the highest number of votes wins, with no requirement to get a majority of votes. In cases where there is a single position to be filled, it is known as first-past-the-post; this is the second most common electoral system for national legislatures, with 58 countries using it to elect their legislatures, the vast majority of which are current or former British or American colonies or territories. It is also the second most common system used for presidential elections, being used in 19 countries.
