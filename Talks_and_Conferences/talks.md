* [Democracy and the pursuit of Randomness](https://youtu.be/e7FwWfUcZTg): **(20/04/2022)** The talk is about panel selection. Say you have some cause like education or climate change and you want to create a panel that represents every part of society -- how do you do so? Say the cause is climate change, and society can be divided into groups like -- very educated, cares about climate, young/old etc. The simplest thing to do is select $k$ out of $n$ people where $k$ is the panel size and $n$ is the population size. Now you send these people letters asking them to be part of panel; what happens is some subset of groups of people care more about certain issues than others. So there's a self selection bias that creeps in and the final panel does not have a lot of representatives from parties that are not too interested in topic. But you want them in the panel as well, as you want everyone's voice heard. One solution against this problem is to put in some sort of lower and upper quota for each type of group in the panel. Then the problem can be described as creating $M$ panels that respect these quotas and then sampling one of these panels uniformly. While the probability of selecting a particular panel is really small, the probability of selecting a specific individual is much higher as they are in the panel. Such an approach has nice fairness properties.
