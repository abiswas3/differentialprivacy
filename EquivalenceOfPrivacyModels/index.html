Consider the problem of releasing the histogram sum
<div class="question">
(I think they are called counting queries or something else or succint histograms)
</div>
<p>of a population of integers privately under the three models:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Laplace Mechanism for Central Privacy</li>
<li>Binomial noise in Shuffle Privacy by <a href="ShufflePrivacy/index.html">Cheu</a></li>
<li>Sample and Threshold Method that was re-derived by Graham.</li>
<li><strong>TODO: <a href="ShuffleSumBinaryRasmus/">Ghazi, Rasmus Pagh – binary sums and histograms</a></strong> is also very closely connected. Working on this as next step if these proofs are correct.</li>
</ol>
We can show they 2 and 3 are equivalent. In terms of how 2 and 3 relate to 1:
<div class="intuition">
I have not proven this fact explicitly yet but I think I can show (1) just happens to be the “sharpest” sub-gaussian noise distribution we can sample from with tails fat enough for the right signal to noise. Conceptually I think it will end up looking like hinge loss and logistic loss where both work in practice. Logistic loss is smoother and nicer but the hinge loss is the tighest convex relaxation to the 0-1 loss.
</div>
<p>We first look at the binary summation problem and then for summation of integers.</p>
<h2 id="binary-sums">Binary Sums</h2>
<p>Each member of the dataset <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> holds a value in <span class="math inline">\(\{0, 1\}\)</span>. We simply want to estimate <span class="math inline">\(f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(X)\)</span> be the estimated sum by the algorithms. Understanding binary sum gives us all the key insights we need to anslyse integer sums. In this writeup we consider the view of the anlyser for the three regimes in consideration. <strong>NOTE:</strong> this is purely for the sake of analysis. In practice they are usually implemented in a federated setting or local/shuffle privacy setting. The noise addition, thresholding and sampling might be done at the user level. We perform all the computations at the analyser level as it simplifies the analysis.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="Definitions/">central privacy</a>, the anlayser sees all the inputs, sums them and adds one instance noise drawn from a Laplace distribution. See picture below:</p>
<div class="algorithm">
<p><img src=pngs/central.png></img></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{f(X)} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Y\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Y \sim Lap(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In shuffle privacy, under the <a href="ShufflePrivacy/index.html">“The binary histogram”</a> section of this writeup we show that the authors just draw <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> random variables <span class="math inline">\(z_i \sim Bernoulli(p_1)\)</span> and add them <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(Y= \sum_{i=1}^n z_i\)</span>, the final answer is just the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> subtracted from <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span>. In all these shuffle privacy papers which claim near central accuracy, this is repeated theme. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> units of little noise that when added up – pretend to be one unit from a smooth sub gaussian distribution. In <a href="ShuffleSumBinaryRasmus/">Ghazi, Rasmus Pagh – binary sums and histograms</a> they dive deep into this with Poisson, Negative Binomial and Discrete Laplace distributions (all infinitely divisible distributions) See picture below:</p>
<div class="algorithm">
<p><img src=pngs/shuffle.png></img></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i + z_i) - E[\sum_{i=1}^n z_i]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i + z_i) - np_1\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(z_i \sim Bernoulli(p_1))\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Both methods add one single instance of noise to the truth: (1) Adds one Laplacian random variable (2) Adds one random variable drawn from a <span class="math inline">\(Binomial(n, p_1)\)</span>. All the work in <a href="ShufflePrivacy/index.html">Cheu</a> is to figure out what values of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is acceptable given <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to ensure privacy. If one were to plot the formulae they use, it shows that only a restricted range of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is possible.</p>
<p>Now consider a simplified version of the sample and threshold algorithm.</p>
<p>The analyser receives values from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> users. For each user, it generates a random variable <span class="math inline">\(z_i \sim Bernoulli(p_2)\)</span>. If the <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> is heads it includes sample <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> in the calculation for the sum, otherwise it does not. This describes Poisson sampling as described in the paper. Thus algorithm is outputting <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n z_i x_i\)</span>. We now show that with a bit of simple algebra, this algorithm is equivalent to the shuffle privacy algorithm for the case of Binary sums.</p>
<p>Define the bit flipping operator as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x} = 1 - x\)</span>. For each <span class="math inline">\(z_i x_i\)</span> the analyser sees, assume it just flips the output to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x_i z_i}\)</span> and uses this sum instead. We are interested in an estimator that in expectation gives us <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\)</span>. Note: there are exactly the same number of random variables in this method as there is in the shuffle method.</p>
<div class="algorithm">
<p><img src=pngs/sample.png></img></p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
c &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n\bar{x_i z_i} \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n(\bar{x_i} + \bar{z_i} )\tag{1}\label{1} \\
&amp;= (n - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i) + (n - \sum_{i=1}^n z_i) \\
&amp;= 2n - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n z_i
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\ref{1}:\)</span> simple boolean algebra, De-Morgan’s Law</p>
<p>The above set of equations ignores thresholding. If the number of 1’s sampled is less than <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the algorithm returns 0. The number of 1’s sampled is <span class="math inline">\(n - c\)</span>, thus if <span class="math inline">\((n - c) \leq \tau\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f(X)} = 0\)</span>. Otherwise</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{f(X)} = -c + 2n - np_2\)</span> which in expectation gives us what we want. Also note that that variance of both estimators are the exact same. In fact they are practically equivalent.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="connection-between-sampling-and-shuffle-privacy-for-histogram-sums">Connection between Sampling and Shuffle privacy for histogram sums</h2>
<p>We have shown that for binary sums, shuffle privacy and sample privacy are equivalent. We now look at the shuffle privacy algorithm <a href="ShufflePrivacy/index.html">described in detail here</a>.</p>
<p>Now each user has a value <span class="math inline">\(x \in \{1, 2, ..., d \}\)</span>. As shorthand we right <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in \left\lfloor d \right\rfloor\)</span>. Cheu et al, just decompose this into <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> binary sum problems for each <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For a particular <span class="math inline">\(j \in \left\lfloor d \right\rfloor\)</span>, all <span class="math inline">\(x_i=j\)</span> are set to 1 and the rest are set to 0. Then the analyser outputs <span class="math inline">\(j \times \hat{f}(X)\)</span> by running the previous algorithm.</p>
<p>Now consider the sampling algorithm. We do the exact same pre-processing for each <span class="math inline">\(j \in \left\lfloor d \right\rfloor\)</span>. Now instead of additive bernoulli noise we just sample/multiply with the random variables as shown above. We have shown equivalence.</p>
<h2 id="analysing-the-parameters">Analysing the parameters</h2>
<p>From the above anlaysis it seems the two methods are doing the same thing - Adding bernoulli random variables to binary inputs. However, the analysis of the two alogrithms produces different dependencies on <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon, \delta\)</span> in the proofs to guarantee privacy. In this section we try and understand this discrepancy. The difference in the two bounds must be in the assumptions and constraints on the parameters given by the problem setup. Note there is a noticebale difference in the problem setups for shuffle privacy and sample-threshold privacy. We describe it the next few sections.</p>
<h3 id="identical-behaviour-for-all-0-input">Identical behaviour for all 0 input</h3>
<p>For an input of all 0’s i.e <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i =0\)</span> both shuffle and sample give 0 error. Part 3 of theorem one proves this in the <a href="ShufflePrivacy/index.html">shuffle privacy</a> case. For the sample and threshold regime, if all inputs <span class="math inline">\(x_i=0\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(c=n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau &gt; 1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\((n - c) &lt; \tau\)</span> always. Thus the algorithm outputs 0.</p>
<h3 id="dependence-on-epsilon-and-delta">Dependence on <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span></h3>
<h4 id="shuffle">Shuffle</h4>
<p>Both regimes guarantee privacy under a good event. Both regimes claim that privacy is preserved with probaility <span class="math inline">\(1 - \delta\)</span> – where <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> shrinks very quickly as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> grows – at least at the rate of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To guarantee privacy, shuffle privacy needs event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and sample-threshold needs event <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. Let these events occur with probability at least <span class="math inline">\(1 - \delta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 - \delta_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The proof for Shuffle privacy works out because the binomial distribution <span class="math inline">\((\epsilon, \delta, k)\)</span>-smooth. Source: [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11358.pdf" title="On the power of multiple anonymous messages">2</a>] define := distribution <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{D}\)</span> is smooth over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\((\epsilon, \delta, k)\)</span> smooth, if <span class="math inline">\(\forall k&#39; \in [-k, k]\)</span> if the event E</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}_{Y \sim \mathbb{D}}\Big[E \geq e^{|k&#39;|\epsilon}\Big] \leq \delta\]</span> or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{P}_{Y \sim \mathbb{D}}\Big[E &lt; e^{|k&#39;|\epsilon}\Big] &gt; 1 - \delta\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math display">\[E=\frac{\mathbb{P}_{Y&#39; \sim D}\Big[Y&#39;=Y\Big]}{\mathbb{P}_{Y&#39; \sim D}\Big[Y&#39;=Y+k&#39;\Big]}\]</span></p>
<p>Appendix C, Lemma 4.12 of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11358.pdf" title="On the power of multiple anonymous messages">2</a>]: proves that a binomial distribution is smooth. They show this by showing that if event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> happens, then event <span class="math inline">\(E &gt; e^{|k&#39;|\epsilon}\)</span> happening is impossible i.e. <span class="math inline">\(E_1 =&gt; E \leq e^{|k&#39;|\epsilon}\)</span> and event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> happens with probality at least 1 - <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>. The event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> is the event that sum of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(Bernoulli(p_1)\)</span> random variables be within a multiplicative factor of the mean. Simply put it is concentrated around its mean or mathematically</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_1 := \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \in [(1 - \alpha)np_1 + k, (1 + \alpha)np_1 - k]\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in (0,1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_i \sim Bernoulli(p_1)\)</span></p>
<p>Event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> can be bounded by the multiplicative chernoff bound. So the <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> in shuffle privacy is pulled from the mulipilicative chernoff bound which needs the sum of bernoulli variables to be concentrated around its mean. The connection between the multiplicative factor <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and the privacy parameter <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = \log(\frac{1 + \alpha}{1- \alpha})\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \frac{e^{\epsilon} - 1}{e^{\epsilon} + 1}\)</span>. So privacy to hold we need,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_1 := \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \in [(1 - \frac{e^{\epsilon} - 1}{e^{\epsilon} + 1})np_1 + k, (1 + \frac{e^{\epsilon} - 1}{e^{\epsilon} + 1})np_1 - k]\]</span></p>
<h4 id="sample-threshold">Sample-Threshold</h4>
<p>Now we look at the event <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> that is needed for privacy to hold. From Grahams AI stats submission, lemma 1 defines <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. Lemma 1 states: the probability that the number of samples of an item is more than <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> times its expectation is at most <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 3 + \log(1/\delta)\)</span>. In the world of just binary numbers, these requirements can be restated as the following:</p>
<p>Given the number of 1’s in the population is k. i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = k\)</span>. Each person <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> has a p_2 chance of being sampled. Thus the expected number of 1’s in the sampled dataset is simply <span class="math inline">\(kp_2=\frac{km}{n}\)</span></p>
<p>Our good event, <strong>which requires <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n} &gt; \frac{1}{k^2}\)</span></strong> Thus we need at least <span class="math inline">\(m &gt; \frac{n}{k^2}\)</span> so we can’t pick any <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_2: = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \leq \tau\frac{km}{n}\]</span>. Finally if we want this event to hold with probability at most <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> must be at least <span class="math inline">\(3 + \log(1/\delta)\)</span>. We get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E_2: = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \leq \Big(3 + \log(1/\delta)\Big)\frac{km}{n}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="ignore">IGNORE</h2>
<p>We fix . For a given <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon, \delta \in [0,1]\)</span>, <a href="ShufflePrivacy/index.html">shuffle privacy</a> requires the number of users <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to be atleast <span class="math inline">\(\frac{100}{\epsilon^2}\log(2/\delta)\)</span> to ensure the release of binary sums is private. There is no user specified parameter like <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> here. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> users show up with a desire for <span class="math inline">\((\epsilon, \delta)\)</span> privacy. If n is above a certain value, then they will get privacy with probability 1 - <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Shown below is a heatmap of the size of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is powers of 10 given different parameter values.</p>
<p><img src=pngs/shuffleN.png></img></p>
<p>In sample and threshold there is a user specified parameter <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> which dictates how many people we sample. This <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> dictates the probability <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span> in the above algorithm. We want to sample <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> users on average, thus <span class="math inline">\(np_2 =m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(p_2=\frac{m}{n}\)</span>. <strong>This the first difference in between the two setups</strong>. In shuffle privacy given <span class="math inline">\(n, (\epsilon, \delta)\)</span> we are allowed to select an optimal value for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (if it is possible). In sample and threshold privacy, someone else gives us <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and it can be value in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> and we have to guarantee privacy from here. Shuffle privacy states that as long as we have <span class="math inline">\(n \geq \frac{100}{\epsilon^2}\log(2/\delta)\)</span> users we are good with high probabilty. The high probability statement is simply saying there is an event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> which happens with probability <span class="math inline">\(1 - \delta\)</span>. If this event <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> happens we get privacy.</p>
<p>Sample privacy on the other hand asks for a requirement on the distribution of values in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> users – this is where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> comes in. We need the number of 1’s in the set of users to be above a certain level.</p>
<p>Now <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> users show up with a desire for <span class="math inline">\((\epsilon, \delta)\)</span> privacy – to guarantee privacy we need</p>
