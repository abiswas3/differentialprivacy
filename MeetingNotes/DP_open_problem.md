### Open Problem in sample and threshold

By the way, I forgot to mention that there is an open problem in the sample and threshold work: 

I can prove that the function $C_{\alpha}$ is at least $\ln(\frac{1}{\alpha}) + \frac{1}{1+\alpha}$, but numerically I believe that this bound should really be $\ln(1 + \frac{1}{\alpha}) + \frac{1}{1+\alpha}$.  

However, proving this would be more difficult, since the approach I followed won't suffice for this.
