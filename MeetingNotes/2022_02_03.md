# Meeting notes for 2021_02_03

## Planned agenda

* Here's a summary of everything that's been solved in Differential Privacy for sums. So what is left? What would be a direction that is relatively novel and would get us a publication in the field? : We discussed this in detail below. 

* Seminars, reading groups -- a bit isolated in London: Graham will introduce via emails to Sam and Mary his students. And not sure what else he will do.

* John Fuer Scholarship: Just wait till Chancellors gets announced.
