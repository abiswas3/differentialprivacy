# Simulation for MPC

`#cryptography` `#mpc` `oblivious transfer` `simulation`


Let's say we have $n$ parties indexed by $\{1, \dots, n \}$. Each party possesses private information $x_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ that they do not want anyone else to know. However, each person also wishes to compute some function over everyone's private values. For example, they might want to compute $f$ where $f$ is the sum of their values $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. One way to compute such an $f$ is for everyone to send their private inputs to a trusted third party, which then outputs only the sum of the inputs to each party and nothing else.

In reality, finding a third party we can trust with our data is difficult (how on earth can we manifest Mufasa ?). So instead, we must design a protocol $\pi_f$ which specifies messages each party must send each other to compute their desired function $f$. For this protocol $\pi_f$ to be helpful, it must satisfy some properties. Firstly, we must ensure that if every party followed the instructions by $\pi_f$, we would compute $f$ correctly. If $f$ is deterministic, then the output of $\pi_f(x_1, \dots, x_n$ must equal $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. If $f$ is random, the two protocols should be `similar` in distribution. Depending on the setting used, the definition of 'similar' changes, but let's not bother with it now.  Secondly, it must be secure. Intuitively we want the protocol to reflect our desire that no one else learns anything about our private values. However, learning anything is hard to define mathematically. We can try to exhaustively list everything we do not want an adversary $\AdvA$ to learn, but this is not very practical. We do not know what information $\AdvA$ will have when using the protocol. For example, the excerpt from [@lindell2017simulate] describes why the exhaustive listing is not a great idea.

```If we say that an adversary receiving a ciphertext cannot output any information about the plaintext, what happens if the adversary already has information about the plaintext? For example, the adversary may know that it is an English text. Of course, this has nothing to do with the security of the scheme since the adversary knew this beforehand and independently of the ciphertext```

So instead, we need a different approach to declare that $\pi_f$ is secure. We first define some limits on the adversarial behaviour we hope to secure against. Note that this definition differs from trying to list everything an adversary can do. It is more of a general description of restrictions we place on adversaries or the class of adversaries we want to defend against. For example, an adversary may be computationally unbounded or restricted to polynomial-time probabilistic computations. An adversary could be passive, i.e. they are forced to follow the instructions of a protocol and can only hope to learn side information by looking at the transcript of the protocol. The adversary could be active or malicious in that they arbitrarily deviate from the $\pi_f$'s specification. An adversary could be static, i.e. their plan of attack is fixed before executing $\pi_f$ or dynamic in which they adapt their strategy based on previous messages. 

Once we define the class of adversaries we want to defend against; we return to our perfect world with Mufasa. Then we construct an algorithm (referred to as the simulator) that interacts with the ideal functionality and interacts with the adversary $\AdvA$ and outputs some information. Informally a  protocol $\pi_f$ is secure if $\AdvA$ can do as much harm in the real world as they are in this perfect world with Mufasa. Put another way; we would like to show that there is a simulator that can output any information that $\AdvA$ can learn in the real world. If this is the case, then $\AdvA$  did not do any real harm as whatever they were able to learn could be learned in our perfect protected world. This discussion is quite abstract, and it might be hard to understand how to construct a secure protocol in practice. To better understand the security of MPC protocols, we look at three protocols that help us compute the oblivious transfer function with the most common classes of adversaries. We choose oblivious transfer, as it is a fundamental MPC primitive that enables us to compute general arithmetic and boolean circuits securely.

## Bit oblivious transfer

We consider the bit oblivious transfer  functionality, defined by $f_{OT}\Big((b0,b1),\sigma \Big) = (\lambda,b_\sigma)$, where $b_0,b_1 ,\sigma ∈ \{0,1\}$.  In words, $P_1$ has a pair of input bits $(b_0,b_1)$ and P2 has a choice bit $\sigma$. The function is such that P1 receives no output (denoted by the empty string $\lambda$), and in particular learns nothing about $\sigma$. In contrast, P2 receives the bit of its choice $b_\sigma$ and learns nothing about the other bit $b_{1−\sigma}$.

**SEE PICTURE**

In this writeup, we only consider static adversaries that are computationally bounded, i.e., PPT. Additionally, as OT is a two-party protocol, we assume that the adversary $\AdvA$ controls one party and is responsible for sending messages.

## Static Semi Honest PPT Adversaries
These are the weakest class of adversaries we work with. Such adversaries cannot force a party to deviate from $\pi_f$. They can only do bad things with what they see while executing $\pi_f$. To define security we first have to describe some general notation. We write down the definition in terms of a 2 party protocol but it can be extended for $n$ party protocol.s

Let $f = (f1,f2)$ be a probabilistic polynomial-time functionality and let $\pi$ be a two-party protocol for computing $f$.

+ The view of the $i$'th party $i \in \{1, 2\}$ during the execution of $\pi$ on inputs $(x,y)$ and security parameter $n$ is denoted by $view_i^\pi(x,y,n)=(w; r^i, m_1^i, \dots, m_t^i)$ where $w \in \{ x, y\}$ depending on the input value of the $i$'th party, $r^i$ is the contents of the internal random tape of the $i$'th party and $m_j^i$ represents the $j$'th message it received from the other party.
+ The output of the $i$'th party denoted by $output_i^\pi(x,y,n)$ is a PPT function of the view of the $i$'th party. The final output of the protcol is given by $output^\pi\big(1^n, x, y, n \big) = \Big(output_1^\pi\big(1^n, x, y, n \big), output_2^\pi\big(1^n, x, y, n \big)\Big)$

:::{.definition name="Security against static semi-honest adversaries"}
We say that $\pi$ securely computes $f$ in presence of static semi-honest adversaries if there exists PPT algorithms $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that the **joint** distribution of the following probability ensembles are computationally indistinguishable

\begin{align}
\{ \Big(S_1 \big(1^n, x, f_1(x,y) \big), f(x,y)\Big) \}_{x, y, n} \overset{\mathsf{comp}}\equiv  \{ \Big(view_1^\pi\Big(1^n, x, y, n \Big), output^\pi\big(1^n, x, y, n \big)\Big)\}_{x, y, n} 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\{ \Big(S_2 \big(1^n, x, f_1(x,y) \big), f(x,y)\Big) \}_{x, y, n} \overset{\mathsf{comp}}\equiv  \{ \Big(view_2^\pi\Big(1^n, x, y, n \Big), output^\pi\big(1^n, x, y, n \big)\Big)\}_{x, y, n} 
\end{align}

### Background

Assume we have a set of trapdoor permutations^[See [@goldreich2009foundations] for more information on one way trapdoor function] $\{ f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n\}$with the property that if we randomly sampled a permutation function from this set, it would be hard to invert.

+ $I(1^n)$ is a PPT algorithm that selects a random $n$-bit index $\alpha$ to obtain $f_{\alpha}$ along with a corresponding trapdoor $\tau$.
+ $S(\alpha)$ is a PPT algorithm that uniformly samples an element from the domain for $f_\alpha$ (or equivalently the range as $f_\alpha$ is a permutation)
+ $F(\alpha, x)$ is a PPT algorithm to compute $f_{\alpha}(x)$
+ $F^{-1}(\tau, y)$ is a PPT algorithm to compute $f_{\alpha}^{-1}(y)$

Next, we describe $\pi_{OT}$ for computing $f_{OT}$ and show that it is secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries.

### Protocol

![Semi Honest OT](bookdown-demo_files/figure-html/semi_honest_ot.png)

It is quite easy to see that the protocol is correct and $P_2$ does receive $b_\sigma$. It is less obvious that it is secure. Hence, we have to construct a simulator which is able to output the same view as the real world adversary controlling party $P_1$ or $P_2$. 

:::{.proof}
Assume that $P_1$ has been corrupted. Note that $P_1$ has no output, thus all the simulator has to do is to output the $P_1$'s view i.e. it has to simulate the messages $y_0, y_1$ it receives from $P_2$. We construct the following simulator $S_1$:

+ $S_1$ already has $(b_0, b_1)$ as input
+ $S_1$ chooses a uniformly distributed random tape $r$ for $P_1$ (of the length required, which is what is needed to run $I$).
+ $S_1$ runs $I(1^n)$ such that $(\alpha, \tau) \xleftarrow R I(1^n)$.
+ It then selects $y_0, y_1$ uniformly randomly from the domain of $f_{\alpha}$ by running $S(\alpha)$ twice.

Finally $S_1$ outputs $(b_0, b_1), r, (y_0, y_1)$. We have constructed a simulator in polynomial time, and now we have to show it's output is indistinguishable from the output of the real-world adversary.

The definition of a collection of trapdoor permutation states that $S(\alpha)$ outputs a value that is almost uniformly distributed in the domain of $f_\alpha$ (and the domain equals the range, since it is a permutation). Thus we have that the distribution $S(\alpha)$ is statistically close to the distribution $F(\alpha, S(\alpha)$. Therefore we can conclude that


\begin{align}
\{ (y_0, F(\alpha, x_1)\} &\overset{\mathsf{comp}}\equiv \{ (y_0, y_1\} &\overset{\mathsf{comp}}\equiv \{ (F(\alpha, x_0), y_1\}
\end{align}


Thus regardless of what value of $\sigma$ $P_2$ picks, the simulator can generate a report that is indistinguishable from that of the real world adversary.

Now consider when $P_2$ has been corrupted. $P_2$'s view includes 

+ It's random tape $r$
+ It's input $\sigma \in \bit$
+ The messages $\alpha, \beta_0, \beta_1$

Note that $S_2$ receives $b_\sigma$ from the trusted third party. So it can set $\beta_\sigma = B(x_\sigma, \alpha) \oplus b_\sigma$ where $(\alpha, \tau) \xleftarrow R I(1^n)$ and $x_\sigma \xleftarrow S(\alpha)$. The challenge is to simulate $\beta_{1 - \sigma}$ as $S_2$ does not know what $b_{1 - \sigma}$ is. Keeping this in mind we construct the following simulator.

+ $S_2$ picks two random tapes $r_0$ and $r_1$^[Since it needs to run $S(\alpha)$ twice].
+ $S_2$ runs $I(1^n)$ such that $(\alpha, \tau) \xleftarrow R I(1^n)$
+ $S_2$ computes $x_\sigma \xleftarrow{r_\sigma} S(\alpha$ where $\xleftarrow{r_\sigma}$ denotes sampling using random tape $r_\sigma$. It then samples $y_{1 - \sigma} \xleftarrow{r_{1 - \sigma}} S(\alpha)$ and computes $x_{1 - \sigma} = F^{-1}(\tau, y_{1 - \sigma})$
+ $S_2$ computes $\beta_{\sigma} = B(\alpha, x_\sigma) \oplus b_\sigma$ and $\beta_{1 -\sigma} = B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})$
+ It outputs $(\sigma, b_\sigma, r_1, r_2, \beta_0, \beta_1)$ as the output to the distinguisher.

Comparing the view of the simulator (RHS) and the real world adversary (LHS) we get

\begin{align}
\text{REAL WORLD } &| \text{ SIMULATOR} \\
\Big(\sigma, b_\sigma, r_1, r_2, B(\alpha, x_\sigma) \oplus b_\sigma, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma}) \oplus b_{1 - \sigma}\Big) &\Bigg| \Big(\sigma, b_\sigma, r_1, r_2, B(\alpha, x_\sigma) \oplus b_\sigma, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})\Big) \\
\Big(\dots, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma}) \oplus b_{1 - \sigma}\Big) &\Bigg| \Big(\dots, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})\Big)
\end{align}

Note the only difference between them is that for the simulator we have $\beta_{1 - 
\sigma} = B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})$ whereas for the real world adversary it is $B(\alpha, x_{1 - sigma}) \oplus b_{1 - \sigma}$. If $b_{1 - \sigma}=0$, then two values are the same and we are done. So all we have to show is that when $b_{1 - \sigma}=1$, we have for all $\sigma, b_{\sigma} \in \bit$ we have that  $B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma}) \equiv B(\alpha, x_{1 - sigma}) \oplus 1$

Assume that the above statement is false i.e. there exists a PPT distinguisher $D$ such that for infinitely many values of the triple $(\sigma, b_{\sigma}, n)$ we have for some polynomial $p$

\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}(\beta_0, \beta_1) \\
=Pr{[D\Big(\dots, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})\Big) = 1]} - Pr{[D\Big(\dots, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma}) \oplus 1 \Big) = 1]} \geq \frac{1}{p(n)} (\#eq:contradiction)
\end{align}



:::{.alert #assumption name="Distinguisher assumption"}
Without loss of generality, we assume that for infinitely many $n$’s, $D$ outputs 1 with greater or equal probability when receiving $B(\alpha, x_{1−\sigma})$ than when receiving $B(\alpha, x_{1−\sigma}) \oplus 1$.
:::

We will construct a PPT algorithm $\AdvA$ that is a simple wrapper around $D$ to guess the bit of hardcore predicate function $B$, leading to a contradiction -- which will imply the above assumption is false.

$\AdvA$ has input $\alpha, \sigma, b_\sigma, r_1, r_2$ and sets $x_{1 - \sigma} = F^{-1}(\tau, y_{1- \sigma})$ where $y_{1- \sigma} \xleftarrow{r_{1 - \sigma}} S(\alpha)$. It also computes $x_\sigma \xleftarrow{r_\sigma} S(\alpha)$ and $\beta_\sigma = B(\alpha, x_\sigma) \oplus b_\sigma$. It sets $\beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess} \xleftarrow{R} \bit$ to a random value. 

It then invokes $D$ with the input $\Big(\sigma, b_\sigma, r_{\sigma}, r_{1 - \sigma}, \beta_\sigma, \beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess}\Big)$. If $D$ outputs 1, then $\AdvA$ leaves $\beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess}$ unchanged, otherwise it flips the bit i.e $\beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess} = \beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess} \oplus 1$


Remember this entire analysis is for $b_{1 - \sigma} = 1$; and in the simulator world $\beta_{1 - \sigma} = B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})$. Thus $\AdvA$ guesses correctly i.e. $\beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess} = \beta_{1 - \sigma} = B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma})$, then it invokes $D$ on input $(\dots, B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma}))$. Otherwise $D$ is invoked on input $(\dots, 1 \oplus B(\alpha, x_{1 - \sigma}))$. Setting $x = x_{1 - \sigma}$ and $\beta = \beta_{1 - \sigma}^{guess}$ to make notation easier, we have

\begin{align}
Pr{[\AdvA \text{ computes } B(\alpha, x)]} &= \frac{1}{2}Pr{[\AdvA \text{ computes } B(\alpha, x)| \text{ right guess}]} \\
      &+ \frac{1}{2}Pr{[\AdvA \text{ computes } B(\alpha, x) | \text{ wrong guess}]} (\#eq:bayes)\\
      &=\frac{1}{2}Pr{[D(\dots, B(\alpha, x)) = 1]} \\
      &+ \frac{1}{2}Pr{[D(\dots, B(\alpha, x) \oplus 1) = 0]} (\#eq:distinguisher)\\
      &= \frac{1}{2}Pr{[D(\dots, B(\alpha, x)) = 1]} \\
      &+ \frac{1}{2}(1 - Pr{[D(\dots, B(\alpha, x) \oplus 1) = 1]})\\
      &=\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{D}(\beta_0, \beta_1) \\
      &\geq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2p(n)} (\#eq:assumption)
\end{align}

\@ref(eq:bayes) comes from Bayes rule and that $\AdvA$ guesses $\beta_{1 - \sigma}$ correctly with probability 1/2. \@ref(eq:distinguisher) comes from the assumption made about distinguishers. Finally \@ref(eq:assumption) comes from the assumption in \@ref(eq:contradiction)

What we have shown is that $\AdvA$ can just invoke $D$ to guess the hard-core predicate of a trapdoor permutation with probability non negligibly greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. This contradicts our assumption about the existence of hard-core predicates and one way functions, therefore the assumption in \@ref(eq:contradiction) must have been wrong. That completes the proof 

:::

:::{.alert}
We remark that this protocol is a good example of the fact that security in the presence of semi-honest adversaries guarantees nothing if the corrupted party does not behave completely honestly. In particular, if $P_2$ generates both $y_0$ and $y_1$ by choosing $x_0$, $x_1$ and computing $y_0 = F(\alpha, x_0)$ and $y_1 = F =(\alpha, x_1)$, then it will learn both $b_0$ and $b_1$. Furthermore, $P_1$ has no way of detecting this at all.

## Static Malicious PPT Adversaries

Next we consider more realistic adversaries that do abide by the rules set by a protocol. Unlike the semi-honest world, the simulator must be able to extract the inputs from the adverasary -- as we do not know apriori what inputs they will use. Note that the simulator cannot talk to the honest party. It can only externally interact with the trusted party and internally with the real world adversary by pretending to be the honest party. Thus to be able to generate the same view as the real world adversary who has access to messages from the honest party, we must give the simulator some extra power. This special power is that of rewinding the adversary. It can send the adversary $\AdvA$ some input to get it to generate some output, and then delete $\AdvA$'s memory completely so that $\AdvA$ has no idea what happened. This trick will prove very useful in proving security in the malicious setting.
