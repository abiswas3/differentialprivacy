does it mean for a crypto system to be semantically secure</h1>
<h2 id="setup-and-notation">Setup and Notation</h2>
<p>Tom and Steve want to send each other private messages <span
class="math inline">\(m \in \mathcal{M}\)</span> over some digital
channel.</p>
<p><strong>Picture</strong></p>
<p>They want to keep secret what they are talking about. We assume they
possess a shared secret key <span class="math inline">\(k \in
\mathcal{K}\)</span>m which they generated using some key generation
algorithm <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that uniformly samples
the key from the key space. They encrypt their message using a
probabilistic cryptosystem <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}= (G,
E, D)\)</span> (for limits of deterministic ones <a
href="../PerfectSecurity/">see</a>) and send the encryption along the
insecure channel.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E: \mathcal{K}\times
\mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(c \xleftarrow{R} E(k, m)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> denotes uniform random coins that the
encryption algorithm uses</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D: \mathcal{K}\times
\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(m^{\prime} = D(k, c)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}_{}\Big[ m^{\prime} = m \Big] =
1\)</span></p>
<p>Now instead of sending <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in the
clear to each other, they send <span
class="math inline">\(c=Enc(k,m)\)</span>. What properties must <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> guarantee for Steve and Tom
to feel safe that Ben cannot decipher anything they are talking about.
One way to describe Ben learns nothing about <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is by the definition of the semantic
security. If the cryptosystem was semantically secure, then it implies
that Ben learns as much about <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> by
looking at <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> as he would have done
if he had not. This statement is mathematically formalized by the
following definition from [[2]].</p>
<h2 id="semantic-security-definition">Semantic Security Definition</h2>
<div class="theorem">
<p>A private-key encryption scheme <span
class="math inline">\((G,E,D)\)</span> is semantically secure (in the
private-key model) if <strong>for every</strong> non-uniform
probabilistic-polynomial time algorithm <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> there <strong>exists</strong> a
non-uniform probabilistic-polynomial time algorithm <span
class="math inline">\(A^{\prime}\)</span> such that for every
probability ensemble <span class="math inline">\(\{ X_n\}_{n \in
\mathbb{N}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(|X_n| \leq
poly(n)\)</span>, every pair of polynomially-bounded functions <span
class="math inline">\(f,h : \{ 0, 1\}^{*} \rightarrow \{ 0,
1\}^{*}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\Bigg| \mathbb{P}_{k \leftarrow G(1^n)}\Big[ A(1^{|X_n|}, E(k, m), 1^n,
h(1^n, m)) = f(1^n, m) \Big] - \mathbb{P}_{}\Big[ A(1^{|X_n|}, 1^n,
h(1^n, m)) = f(1^n, m) \Big] \Bigg| \leq \frac{1}{p(n)}
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>for all polynomials <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In simple words</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the above definition <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is
the security parameter. The bigger <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the more unlikely it is that Ben
will win. However, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> will take longer, so there is a
trade-off.</p></li>
<li><p>Ben the is non-uniform probabilistic-polynomial time algorithm
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. The non uniform in the
definition just gives Ben more power. It says it can change it’s
strategy for a given specific security parameter size. It does not have
to plan one strategy in advance for all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Charlie is non-uniform probabilistic-polynomial time algorithm
<span class="math inline">\(A^{\prime}\)</span>. The definition says for
every conniving deceitful Ben there will always be a clueless Charlie,
who does not see anything but just tries to guess things.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(X_n\)</span> is the message space
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> for a given security
parameter <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The message space is
bounded in some polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> so
it is reasonable that Ben could try every <span class="math inline">\(m
\in X_n\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We give Ben the length of the message <span
class="math inline">\(1^{|X_n|}\)</span>, the length of the security
parameter <span class="math inline">\(1^{n}\)</span>, the encryption of
the message <span class="math inline">\(E(k, m)\)</span> and all the
auxiliary information about <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> can
be computed by <span class="math inline">\(h(1^n, m)\)</span>. Note if
<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> revealed something about <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> then it’s not the crypto-systems fault.
<span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is public knowledge. We can’t
hide something that is already out there for everyone to see. Ben uses
all this information to guess an arbitrary poly function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> about the message <span
class="math inline">\(f(1^n, m)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We give Charlie everything but the encryption. So essentially Charlie
is sitting in his own garden talking to no one, seeing no one. He also
tries to guess what Ben guessed. <strong>If my system is semantically
secure, they both have the practically shot at getting it
right.</strong> The only difference between Ben and Charlie is that one
has access to attacking the crypto-system. Charlie sits in what we call
an ideal world, and simulates the behavior of Ben.</p>
<div class="intuition">
<p>That definition is a handful. It very clearly defines what it means
to be secure but it seems like proving something to be semantically
secure could be a nightmare. So lets instead prove other simpler things
and hope those will imply this. Then we’d get the best of both worlds.
Easy proofs and strong guarantees.</p>

<p>What if instead of providing semantic security as defined above, my
cryptosystem just prevented the Adversary from being able to distinguish
between encryptions? Would my system provide more security or less
security?</p>

<p>For the remainder of the document, we show how the above two
definitions are equivalent. Furthermore, if a system is semantically
secure,</p>
