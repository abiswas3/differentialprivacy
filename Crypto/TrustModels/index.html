<h1 id="who-should-we-trust-and-how-counting-in-the-real-world">Who
should we trust and how: Counting in the real world</h1>
<p>Counting is probably the most fundamental and widely used
mathematical primitive today. It allows us to answer questions such as
“How many votes did the republican party receive?”, “Do cycling fans
prefer Primoz Roglic over Tadej Pogacar?”, “How many users used the new
Beta feature launched by Apple.” or “How many people in a given
neighbourhood have committed a felony”. In theory, these questions can
be answered by asking the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’th user
to send in their response <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> to an
aggregator. After receiving all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
inputs, the aggregator outputs <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n
x_i\)</span>. Researchers have been dealing with this question: Who does
the aggregating and how? One might ask, why does it matter? In this
post, I hope to try and articulate why and when such a question matters.
I picked the questions above intentionally, as they each describe a
practical trust model between the client and the aggregator.</p>
<h2 id="roglic-or-pogacar">Roglic or Pogacar ?</h2>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> “Do cycling fans prefer Primoz Roglic over
Tadej Pogacar?”</p>
<p>Global Cycling Network(GCN) wants to run a survey to decide on the
more popular bike rider. Roglic and Pogacar are arguably the best grand
tour cyclists globally and have partisan fan bases. A quick search on
Twitter should convince the reader of this statement. These fans do not
want their allegiances kept secret. In fact, they often go out of their
way to get involved in <a
href="https://twitter.com/janibrajkovic/status/1379449290104389634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Twitter
arguments</a> over which rider is better. This observation is not
restricted to cycling. The internet is riddled with fan debates on
Messi-Ronaldo, Federer-Nadal-Djokovic, and Verstappen-Hamilton. Using an
external service, such as Google or Survey Monkey, is an acceptable
solution to aggregate fan votes. The fans don’t want their voice to
remain secret, and Google has no incentive to bias the output towards a
specific candidate (Roglic winning a fan poll is unlikely to affect
Google’s stock prices, so they are unlikely to risk a scandal for such a
cause). The figure below illustrates how we can find out who the more
popular rider is.</p>

<h2 id="new-feature-usage-estimates">New feature usage estimates</h2>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> How many users used the new Beta feature
launched by Apple.” or “How many people in a given neighbourhood have
committed a felony”</p>
<p>Tech companies/Governments want to understand how users are using
their services. For example, Google wanted to understand the flash
adoption rate for chrome, Apple wanted to know which emoji’s were
popular, and the US government wanted to understand census information
about a population. A key defining factor in the examples used in this
section is that it is not critical we get an exact answer. A close
enough estimate is fine. Most importantly, these organisations want to
ensure that no single user information is compromised because they chose
to participate in this process. <a
href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Local_differential_privacy#:~:text=Local%20differential%20privacy%20(LDP)%20is,about%20the%20user&#39;s%20personal%20data.">Local
differential privacy</a> is an acceptable solution to this problem. No
party - the aggregator nor the other clients can be sure of that user’s
real input. Of course, this comes at the cost of some loss of accuracy.
This accuracy can be further relaxed under the <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11839">shuffle privacy</a> model, but
we cannot expect the answers to be exact, but the actual social outcome
did not require precision. <strong>Note:</strong> although we are not
guaranteed correctness or even expected behaviour, there are enough use
cases for this model to be helpful. While collecting information, these
organisations usually use software written by them in the first place.
So it is reasonable to assume that the clients will not deviate from
their protocols.</p>
<p><img src="pngs/LDP.png" width="90%"></img></p>
<p>Another model for estimating user behaviour is only to consider
events that occur at most <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>
times. For example, say Mozilla or Brave wanted to know which websites
were popular amongst its clientele. Specifically, they only want to know
of a website if it’s used by enough users. Otherwise, knowledge of a
website might compromise the personal preferences of one of its users.
Moreover, they wish to striker a commercial deal with popular websites
(or boost their rank in their search features), so it is essential to
know which website is most popular. Therefore, they cannot tolerate the
error introduced by differential privacy. Additionally, like in the
above two use cases, Mozilla or Brave have no incentive to tamper with
the results. After all, they were the ones who wanted to conduct this
survey. In this case, using Brave’s <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10074">STAR</a> approach makes
sense.</p>

<h2 id="did-trump-win">Did Trump win?</h2>
<p>The outcome of political elections could strongly affect an
organisation’s future. For example, a victory for a particular party
might afford the aggregation party (say Google or Facebook or IBM) tax
benefits for the upcoming years. Now we cannot trust that a single
entity has not been compromised. In all the examples above, the
aggregator is never incentivised to lie about the answer, but now it
does. This brings us to the PRIO/Poplar model. Now we have <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> aggregators who need to work together
to get the correct answer. Furthermore, as long as only one party is
honest, we can guarantee that all will be well. <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is can be seen as a social security
parameter i.e. the greater <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the
harder it is for an adversary to bribe the outcome of the election.</p>
<ul>
<li>In PRIO/Poplar, “all well” ensure info theoretic privacy guarantees
for every honest party. The focus is privacy.</li>
<li>In our work, “all well” ensures that the correct answer is always
output or exposing the cheater publicly and verifiably. The focus is
correctness.</li>
</ul>
