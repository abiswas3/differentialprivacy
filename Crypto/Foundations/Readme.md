# Lecture Notes in Cryptography

**Disclaimer:** I have no formal education in cryptography or complexity theory, but
in my old age I have decided to pursue research in related areas. This
page and its children pages are my notes from studying different
concepts in modern cryptography. They are designed to be consumed by
me only and are likely full of typos.
