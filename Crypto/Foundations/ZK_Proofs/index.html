<p><strong>Why:</strong>These notes are based on Chapter 4 of [<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Foundations-Cryptography-v1-Basic-Tools/dp/0521035368" title="Foundations of Cryptography V1">1</a>]. At the time of writing, I wanted to understand and re-derive the proofs for Poplar and Prio, so I could write my own paper.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-zero-knowledge-proofs">Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs</h2>
<h2 id="knowledge-vs-information">Knowledge Vs Information</h2>
<p><em>Knowledge is related to computational difficulty, whereas information is not</em>. Assume that Alice and Bob have access have access to a public Graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Alice answers questions of the form “Is the graph Eulerian?” or “Is the graph Hamiltonian?”. From an information-theory point of view, answers to both questions give Bob 1 bit of information (yes or a no), so the answers are equivalent.</p>
<p><em>Knowledge relates mainly to publicly known objects,whereas information relates mainly to objects on which only partial information is publicly known.</em> Consider the case in which Alice answers each question by flipping an unbiased coin and telling Bob the outcome. From an information-theoretic point of view, Bob gets from Alice information concerning an event. However, we say that Bob gains no knowledge from Alice, because he could toss coins by himself.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be two interactive turing machines (ITM). Let <span class="math inline">\(\langle A,B \rangle(x)\)</span> be the random variable representing the local output of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> when interacting with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> on common input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><b>The Complexity of an Interactive Machine: </b> We say that an ITM <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has time complexity <span class="math inline">\(t: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span>, if for <strong>every</strong> ITM <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <strong>every</strong> common input string <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, machine <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> regardless of its or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>’s random tape; halts in <span class="math inline">\(t(|x|)\)</span> steps. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is poly time if there exists a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(t=p\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="interactive-proof-system">Interactive Proof System</h3>
<div class="theorem">
<p>A pair of ITM’s <span class="math inline">\((P,V)\)</span> is called an interactive proof system for a language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> if machine <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is polynomial time and the following two hold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Completeness: For every <span class="math inline">\(x \in L\)</span> and given prover <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}[\langle P,V \rangle(x) = 1] \geq \frac{2}{3}\)</span></p></li>
<li>Soundness: For every <span class="math inline">\(x \notin L\)</span> and <u>and every interactive machine <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span></u>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}[\langle B,V \rangle(x) = 1] \leq \frac{1}{3}\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="every-language-in-mathcalnp-has-an-interactive-proof-system">Every language in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{NP}\)</span> has an interactive proof system</h2>
<p>By definition of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{NP}\)</span> there is a polynomial time verifier that approves provers witness.</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#blah">
Exercise 2: Only languages in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{NP}\)</span> have interactive proof systems in which both parties are deterministic
</button>
<div id="blah" class="collapse">

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{NP}\)</span> can be viewed as a class of interactive proof systems in which the interaction is unidirectional (i.e., from the prover to the verifier) and the verifier is deterministic (and never errs)</p>
<p>In general proof systems, this requirement is waived. The communication is bi-directional and the verifier could be probabilistic. Such a class is referred to as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{IP}\)</span></p>

<p>Existence of weak one way functions implies existence of strong one way functions</p>
