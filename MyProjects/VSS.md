[Round-Optimal and Efficient Verifiable Secret Sharing](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/11681878_17.pdf) is a build from the original work by Ben Or and Shafi Goldwasser called [[Completeness Theorems for Non-Cryptographic Fault-Tolerant Distributed Computation]]. In that they show the limits of MPC and secret sharing etc.


Some bloke in London Royal Holloway has also written [[Challenging the adversary model in secret sharing schemes]]
