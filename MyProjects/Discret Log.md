# Diffie Helman Key Exchange

If the Diffie-Hellman protocol has any hope of being secure, it must be hard to compute$\alpha$ from $g^\alpha$ for a random $\alpha$; in other words, it must be hard to compute the discrete logarithm function. There are a number of candidate group families $G$ where the discrete logarithm function is believed to be hard to compute. For example when $p$ and $q$ are large, suitably chosen primes => the discrete logarithm function in the order $q$ subgroup of $\Z^*_p$ is believed to be hard to compute. (p should be at least 2048-bits, and q should be at least 256-bits). This assumption is called the **discrete logarithm assumption** 

## Attack Game : Discrete Logarithm
Let $\G$ be a cyclic group of prime order $q$ generated by $g \in \G$. For a given adversary $\A$, define the following attack game:

+ Challenger computes $\alpha \xleftarrow{R} \Z_q$, $u = g^\alpha \in \G$ 
+ Challenger sends to $\A$ : $u$

+ Adversary tries to guess $\alpha$ by outputting $\hat{\alpha} \in \Z_q$. Let the advantage of the adversary for the group be $DLADV[\A, \G] = \P{\hat{\alpha} = \alpha}$. 

**DEFINITION**: We say the the Discrete Log Assumption holds for $\G$ if for all efficient adversaries $\A$, $DLADV[\A, \G]$ is negligible.


Unfortunately, the discrete logarithm assumption by itself is not enough to ensure that the Diffie-Hellman protocol is secure.  The protocol is secure if and only if the computational diffie hellman assumption holds.
